# ESA DHS Application
This repository hosts the source code of the **Shiny dashboard** on ESA DHS data. The dashboard can be accessed on shinyapps.io via the following [link](https://alinacherkas.shinyapps.io/esa-dhs-app/). Allow for up to a minute for the application to load.

## Description
The dashboard uses data extracted from the [Spatial Data Repository](https://spatialdata.dhsprogram.com/home/) of the DHS programme. To enhance user experience, the dashboard uses dependency data files extracted from the DHS website instead of a live API connection. There are 177 indicators available yjay split into 9 categories: *Child Health, Child Nutrition, Family Planning, Fertility, Fertility Preferences, HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Reproductive Health and Sexual Activity*. The dashboard covers - at  least to some degree - 19 of 21 ESA countries, including:

- Angola
- Botswana
- Burundi
- Comoros
- Eritrea
- Eswatini
- Ethiopia
- Kenya
- Lesotho
- Madagascar
- Malawi
- Mozambique
- Namibia
- Rwanda
- South Africa
- Tanzania
- Uganda
- Zambia
- Zimbabwe

The application can be used for exploring the overall distribution of the indicators, their geographic variation as well as conduct basic spatial regression analysis.
