  The app uses data from the DHS <a href="https://spatialdata.dhsprogram.com/home/" target="_blank">Spatial Data Repository</a> to analyse a range of
  health and demographic indicators in 21 countries in <a href="https://www.unicef.org/esa/where-we-work" target="_blank">Eastern and Southern Africa</a>.
  It provides an easy-to-use interface to analyse the data using data exploration tools like <b>Choropleth maps</b> and histograms as well as
  statistical inference tests like regression plots and <b>spatial autoregressive (SAR) models</b>. The latter is estimated using spatial weights matrix with queen
  criterion.
